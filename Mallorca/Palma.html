						 <p><strong>About the Capital City of Mallorca</strong></p>
					</p>

					<p>
						Palma is Mallorca's vibrant capital, stylish and intimate, yet bursting with life. Half of the island's population dwells in this city, lively all year round with luxury hotels, trendy restaurants, cafes, shops and nightlife as well as a thriving art scene. It's often compared to Barcelona and, being within a 15-minute taxi ride from the airport, it makes for the perfect city break.
					</p>

					<p>Located in the south of the island, Palma looks out over the shimmering Mediterranean sea (take a look at our webcam to see it in real time). Whilst there are many enchanting parts of the city, the main attractions and shops are situated around the massive Gothic cathedral down by the sea front. This area, known as Palma’s old town, is full of ancient passages, historic monuments and magnificent architecture. Here you will find no shortage of sights or refreshment stops within its many pedestrianised lanes, quirky cafes, galleries, and boutique shops. Thanks these attractions all being packed within a square kilometre, the old town is easy to explore.
					</p>

					<p>
						The first thing you will notice when you arrive in Palma from the airport is the fabulous marina and seafront, perfectly accompanied with a palm tree-lined promenade. Dominating the skyline by the sea is the iconic cathedral (called La Seu) and the Parc de la Mar, a large park in front of it which hosts many concerts, fiestas and open-air cinema throughout the year.
					</p>

					<p>
						 After arriving in Palma, the old town is probably the best place to start as a visitor. You can begin at the cathedral and along Passeig des Born as it’s not only picturesque but easy to navigate. At this point, you can’t help but be impressed with the city has to offer. This grand avenue features high-street and designer shops to cater for everybody’s needs. From here there are a few options, follow the road around to the right onto the tree lined promenade of La Rambla, home to florists and newspaper sellers, or onto Avinguda Jaume III for further shops and stunning architecture.
					</p>

					<p>
						For most Majorca Mallorcans, history didn't really begin until the Catalans retook the island from the Moors in the 13th century. On the other hand, experts date the first islanders to between 1300 and 1000BC. Even though the earliest people obviously carried on primitive but active trade with others around the western Mediterranean, the quantity of arms found in their early dwellings shows that the island still had a long way to go before becoming the 'Island of the Calm'.
					</p>

					<p>
						As an island, Mallorca has been subject to numerous invasions and conquests throughout its history. Palma was known to the Arabs as Medina Mayurqa (902 to 1229), and to Mallorcans thereafter simply as Ciutat (City). But the city was in fact named after the Roman city of Palmaria (founded around 120 BC), which still exists a metre or two beneath the ground; inhabitants of houses near the cathedral are still discovering Roman remains every once in a while.</p>

						<p>Palma's current image owes much to the last two hundred years. The two iconic roads of Passeig des Born and Las Ramblas were built in the 19th century on a dried-up river bed. The defensive city walls which once surrounded the city were pulled down to create the ring road of Las Avingudas and the waterfront highway and promenade Passeig Maritim were only reclaimed from the sea in the 1950s.</p>


						<p>Alternatively, once you have your bearings and are keen to explore the ancient passages, head slightly west of Passeig des Born. Here you will find the quaint, ancient district of Sa Llotja (or La Lonja), which is home to some of Palma’s finest boutiques, art galleries and Spanish restaurants. If you decide to venture east of Passeig des Born, you'll find gift shops, fashion boutiques, shoe shops and cafes. On this side also lies Plaça Major, which holds markets featuring arts and crafts and other touristy trinkets. This area encompasses Plaça Cort where the handsome Mallorcan Town Hall resides, and another popular shopping street called Sant Miquel. You will also likely stumble upon the Olivar Market, a traditional Spanish undercover market selling all sorts of fresh produce.</p>


						<p>Palma is certainly a city packed full of fun events whatever the time of year. Let’s kick off with the fiestas and fairs because they are some of the most spectacular events you could attend. Palma knows how to celebrate and bring people together, and boy do you get to know the real city when it hosts one of its fiestas.</p>
						<h2><Span style="color:red ">Traditional Fiestals,Cultural,Gastronomic,Sporting events</span> </h2>
							<img width="500" height="200"/ src="images/fiesta.jpg" alt="fiesta.jpg" id="mallorcaImage" />

						<p>Apart from the usual traditional festivals celebrated in Spain, you really should try to get involved in the city's two main fiestas: Sant Sebastiá which is held in January and Sant Joan that takes place in June. Others to watch are the Three Kings Parade on the eve of the Epiphany (5th of January) and Sa Rua, Mallorca’s very own carnival in February.</p>

						<p>Sant Sebastian is Palma's patron saint and the city comes out in force to celebrate. You can expect street parties with BBQs and music concerts, followed by parades, fireworks and a Correfoc "The running Devil fire" in the lead up to the more formal proceedings taking place on the actual saint's day of the 20th January, a public holiday in Palma.</p>

						<p>Sant Joan is celebrated on the 24th June as part of the summer solstice but, again, it's the evening before that sees the biggest party. The infamous ‘Nit de Foc', or Night of Fire is held on the night of the 23rd June and sees bonfires lit throughout the city and the crazy ‘fire run' where locals dress as demons and devils and run through the streets bearing torches. Everyone eventually gathers in the Parc de la Mar for concerts, more bonfires, firecrackers and an impressive fireworks display.
						</p>

						<p>Art lovers should attend Nit de l'Art in September when the art galleries and restaurants display art to the public with canapes and wine. There are a couple of grand theatres in the city which host annual opera and ballet festivals, their programmes are speckled with musicals, concerts and other ‘spectacles'. Look out for details on the Bellver Castle Music Festival, a popular occasion in the summer months. There are also several jazz clubs in La Llonja, and other live music venues (bars) can be found throughout Palma.</p>

						<p>For the foodies, the Spanish love of food is reflected in gastronomic events throughout the year. Every Tuesday La Ruta Martiana takes place in Palma’s old town. Bars offer their patrons a small tapa or pintxo plus a caña of beer for a modest €2.0 or €3.0. It's a great way to discover authentic Spanish bars and cuisine away from the touristy areas of the city. On a larger scale, be sure to check out the Tapa Palma event. These tapas routes at the end of October are great for encouraging people to explore the more hidden bars and restaurants of Palma, each establishment serving unique quality tapas and wines for a reduced fee. Participating bars and restaurants are marked on a handy map of the area which you can pick up in bars and cafes.
						Some of the Mallorquins'(Mallorcans) typical foods are: <li>Paella de Arroz.</li> <li> Sobrasada</li> <li> Chorizos</li> <li> Tapas </li> <li> Pam amb Oli</li>
						</p>

						<p>Much like the rest of the island, Palma has its fair share of sporting events. The city has its own marathon in October, as well as a range of cycling events, and is a renowned hub for numerous sailing regattas in the Mediterranean, not to mention it has its own International Boat Show held on the first May bank holiday weekend.  There isn’t anything quite like it! Mallorca has its own football team that normally plays in Spain’s top division. Their stadium is on the outskirts of Palma (Son Moix) and tickets are relatively easy to come by.
						There is also the Marathon know as "Lluc a Peu".</p>

						<p> The you youth also enjoy the late night Beach Drinking ,known as "Botellón"</p>
						<p> If you are looking for a good place to enjoy Spanish Cuisine, there are many top class restaurants located around Plaça d’Espanya. Eating with the locals means you'll find fantastic food at some remarkably reasonable prices. For tapas or a heartier Spanish inspired meal, head to streets like Carrer del 31 de Diciembre and Carrer de Blanquerna, each featuring some top restaurants. </p>

						<p> And if you want to go for some international yet innovative cuisine, then the trendy area of Santa Catalina will certainly hit the spot. Here you'll find anything from modern tapas and homemade Italian to South American and Asian fusion. Due to the number of restaurants popping up in this area, there's a high level of competition which makes both the quality and prices equally good.</p>
						<p>Love Sea Foods and a traditional Spanish paella? Make your way by venturing towards Portixol and Molinar, only 3km from the cathedral. These traditional fishing ports offer up some of the best paellas on the island.</p>

						Interesting Places to visit
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<h4><li><p><strong>La Lonja </strong></p></li></h4>
						<p>La Lonja is at the heart of the city's nightlife during the evenings. Whether it’s late night restaurants, pubs, cocktail bars or jazz clubs you're after, you'll find something to tickle your taste buds. Be sure to check out hotel bars and sky bars too as they offer some of the best cocktails in the city centre</p>

						<h4><li><p><strong>Santa Catalina</strong></p></li></h4>
						<p>Santa Catalina is swarming with people in the evening whatever the time of the year. A number of watering holes in the form of late night bars that locals, expats and tourists like to frequent reside here. It's also where you'll find the yacht crews hanging out, especially along Carrer de San Magí.</p></li>

						<h4><li><p><strong>Paseo Marítimo</strong></p></li></h4>
						<p>The Paseo Marítimo (the front by the marina) is absolutely buzzing when the warm nights set in from June until September. This area makes for the perfect night out on the tiles thanks to its restaurants, late-night bars and a couple of large-scale nightclubs. For those who like to party until 05:00, the main club to call is Tito's. You won’t miss it</p></li></h4>

						<h4><li><p><strong>Medieval buildings</strong></p></li></h4>
						<p>Palma's most iconic building is its Gothic cathedral, La Seu; built on the site of a mosque which in turn was once a Roman temple, it rises out of the city walls which used to mark the edge of the sea. Next to the cathedral is L'Almudaina, a 13th-century palace with splendid gardens. It’s worth a little walk behind these magnificent buildings, as here you will find the old Arab quarter, with its labyrinth of narrow streets (be careful not to get lost!).  To the west of Palma, on top of a hill, sits Bellver Castle, a unique round castle from the 14th century with some of the best views in the city.</p></li>

						<h4><li><p><strong>The Arab Quarter</strong></p></li></h4>
						<p>This Arab quarter contains many of Palma’s hidden treasures, including little museums, charming courtyards and unique architecture. There are numerous exhibitions dedicated to the history of Mallorca, religious artefacts, or antique toys. Behind the Arab quarter is the renowned Plaça Cort which embodies Palma Town Hall and the legendary old olive tree. This ancient tree is a masterpiece in itself, it’s believed to be about 800 years old and is one of the city's most admired landmarks.</p></li>

						<h4><li><p><strong>Modernist architecture</strong></p></li></h4>
						<p>You can’t help but notice the modernist architecture in Palma, this is all thanks to Gaudi's influence when he was on the island to oversee restoration works to the cathedral. The best known is the Fundació La Caixa, designed by the Catalan architect Lluis Domenech i Montaner, it was the building that began the craze for Modernist (Art Nouveau) architecture in the city. There are plenty of other examples in the old town, just take a stroll around, look upwards and absorb the sights.</p></li>

						<h4><li><p><strong>Contemporary art</strong></p></li></h4>
						<p>If it's arts and culture that you're interested in, then Palma will not disappoint. The excellent Es Baluard Museum of Contemporary Art is housed in the old fortress and is well worth a visit, the restaurant on the terrace is critically acclaimed too. The Spanish artist Joan Miró spent the best part of 30 years living on Mallorca and there is a foundation devoted to his works just to the west of Palma. There are also several other art galleries featuring Spanish artists and contemporary art.</p></li>
